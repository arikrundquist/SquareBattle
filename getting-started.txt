///////////////////////////////
//  Welcome to the project!  //
///////////////////////////////

First steps:
  1. add your ip address to the newly created ip.txt
     - this is how docker knows where to forward graphics to
  2. install docker and an X11 server
     - i use xlaunch
       - default configuration is fine, except make sure to check disable access control
  3. verify your install by running xeyes
     - switch the CMD to run at the end of Dockerfile
     - make run will run the container and should open a window with a pair of eyes
       - it might open behind other windows
  4. restore the Dockerfile to its previous state and make run
     - this will:
       1. build the backend
       2. build and run any tests
       3. run the backend if all tests passed
  5. check out the tentative spec

Project structure:
  * Disclaimer: the current structure is a little janky and should probably change significantly *

  1. api/ defines the interface between the backend and user implementations
  2. game/ contains the core runners for the frontend and backend
     - backend.cc is the main application, and launches the frontend and spawns a process for each team
     - graphics.py is the frontend and communicates with the backend through a memory mapped file
  3. utils/ contains utility classes
     - Timer provides a basic mechanism to track elapsed time
     - ProcessQueue provides simple interface to interact between processes
       1. Create a ProcessQueue<Message, Reponse> in shared memory
       2. Fork or otherwise create a process using the same memory
       3. One process calls the queue with a Message, the other serves a Response
  4. teams/ is where teams will be dynamically loaded from

Next steps:
  - develop the api
    - define the Message-Response pair
    - handle multiple actions
      - probably just a flag in the response that there is more data to grab
  - write some basic teams
  - implement the game
    - assuming a cooperative user
  - implement time out functionality so a bad user can't lock up the game
  - misc clean up
  - add more tests
